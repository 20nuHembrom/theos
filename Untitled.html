I. THE ORIGIN OF MAN
God’s decree of creation is “the mystery of his will” (Eph 1:9). We shall never be able to totally
comprehend the “why?” of creation. It is a mystery hidden in the very being of God. At the same
time, the Holy Scripture gives an answer to the question of the “the what for?” of creation.
5
Rom 11:36 For of him, and through him and to him, are all things.
Col 1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth.
Creation is a glorification of God himself! The claim that God could not live without his creation is10
not valid, since God already existed before he created the universe. But we cannot know or discern
what God had been doing before our creation. The triune and eternal God, who has neither a
beginning of days nor an end of life… what could he have been doing prior to creating us? Could
he, in his eternal existence – all alone – possibly have been lonely? Or were there other worlds and
creatures before us? We do not know. The Bible gives us no answers to these questions of15
curiosity. The day will come, when all our questions will be answered… or – maybe one should
better say – on that day all such questions will probably not bother us anymore. We speak of the
day, when we shall see him face to face (cf. 1Co 13:12; 1Jo 3:2; Rev 22:3-5).
The purpose of the Bible is not to satisfy our curiosity. The Word of God is practical, a book with20
information and guidance for our lives: Where do we come from? Why and for what reason are we
here? Why are we as we are and not different? Where does evil come from? How can we escape
evil and its consequences?
But there are also questions which are not answered:25
• Why is salvation destined only for man and not (also) for fallen angels? (Heb 2:16; cf. Mat
25:41)
• What will happen to the animals in the world to come? Will I meet my beloved dog or parrot in
an after world? (cf. Ecc 3:20-21)30
• Will we all recognise each other again?
• Will we in the world to come be thinking of people who will not be saved?
• What will we be doing in a “never ending eternity”? Will we still be playing football?
The Bible is a manual for our life. In it, God gives us information and instructions which we need35
for a life according to his will. The Bible is enough to allow us to live in accordance with his will.
What is not written there is not essential for our life.
It is important to know that it is God who has created us, to know his will for our life, also to know
that all are sinners since the fall of Adam and Eve and to know that God still loves us and has40
promised the Saviour (cf. proto-gospel in Gen 3:15). This promise has been fulfilled in Jesus
Christ, his Son. Everyone who believes in him and accepts him as Saviour and Lord receives
eternal life. The Bible answers all these essential questions. If it does not tell us what God was
doing before our creation, then God did not think it necessary to explain it to us, and if he does not
tell us in detail what we shall be doing in eternity…, maybe it is meant to be a surprise for us. He45
